# Contribution

## I have a bug
First, check if there is an existing issue about your bug. Make sure to check for closed issues, as it may have been reported but not considered a bug. If an issue already exists, feel free to comment on it with extra details.

If no issue exists, make one. I will look at it and see if it is a bug, and work on fixing it.

## I have a feature request
First, check if there is an existing issue suggesting the feature. Make sure to check for closed issues, as it may have been suggested but rejected. If an issue already exists, feel free to comment on it with extra details.

If no issue exists, make one. I will look at it and see if I want it to be included. JumpButton is designed to be simple, so new features are not likely, but if I see a suggestion I like, I may add it.

## Contributing code
Only make pull requests for features or bugs that have an issue associated with them. Pull requests without issues are unlikely to be approved.

Code should follow the [Roblox Style Guide](https://roblox.github.io/lua-style-guide/) and be strictly typed. Ideally, every variable should explicitly define its type, barring a few exceptions (such as module requires).
